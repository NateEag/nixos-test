## Is NixOS My Next OS?

I don't know.

I'm hoping to try to figure out in here.


## Media Consumption

My first goal is to come up with a NixOS VM that can play Netflix, Amazon
Prime, and YouTube videos.

If I can get all of those working, then I have the basis for a viable media PC.
Buy an IntelNUC, get an acceptable UI for using those tools (some kind of
physical remote control or mobile-app-based UI, probably)

That would let us stop relying on our increasingly-flakey old Galaxy S5s for
watching the aforementioned things.
